  <p><p>My blog is 6 years old and 200 posts, and over 120k hits, Probably my first <em>interesting</em> post is <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2008/03/wiped-out-svn.html">when decided I was switching to git from svn,</a> and it&rsquo;s not very interesting, and I think much more poorly written than I write things now. Since then I&rsquo;ve re-skinned the blog to new templates at least twice. I now list books that I recommend on the right side of my blog, and I&rsquo;ve ensured that all content is clearly licensed under the creative commons. Personally I&rsquo;ve moved from being a student, to system administrator, to Perl developer, and am now building things with Java and potentially Ruby.</p><p>Given that I&rsquo;m now building things in Java and Ruby their may be posts that are about those technologies and the good and bad things I&rsquo;ve found out about them. One thing I&rsquo;ll say is that some of the Java as a language hate is as unfounded as the hate for Perl. All languages have good and bad things about them, even Perl 6 has warts in its design. </p><p>Since Java is my full time job now, and I have little reason to be doing Perl as I&rsquo;ve been unhappy with the Perl 5 Framework landscape, I&rsquo;m unlikely to continue developing features for my Perl 5 modules. If you&rsquo;re interested in becoming a comaintainer on any of my modules, my requirement is that you show interest in the module by contributing high quality patches to that module. I&rsquo;d like to see evidence that I won&rsquo;t have to come back and fix things later, and that your interest is sincere. If you&rsquo;re not interested in being a comaint patches are still welcome. </p><p>I haven&rsquo;t found frameworks that I&rsquo;m completely happy with in any other language either, at this point I&rsquo;m considering making a very minor project developing a full framework for Perl 6. This framework (probably split into components) would be built on a new Dependency Injection module, using what I&rsquo;ve learned from Bread::Board, AngularJS, and Java&rsquo;s CDI. It would also include an ORM that is based on Data Mapper principles and make high use of introspection. I would like to mention I have some doubt in myself making serious traction, but we&rsquo;ll see</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
