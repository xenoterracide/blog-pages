  <p>I was going to write something up about what&rsquo;s wrong with open source developers. But Beranger beat me to it by explaining why <a href="http://www.beranger.org/edito2008/index.php">Open Source is not about love</a>.<br /><br />I agree with him on everything except what he says about kde (and even that&rsquo;s not wrong kde4 just isn&rsquo;t ready to be judged yet).<br /><br />I have one thing to say in addition to it though.<br /><br />There are 4 kinds of open source developers<br /><br />1.) The insulting arrogant loud mouth<br />2.) The developer that doesn&rsquo;t develop and is never heard from<br />3.) The developer that develops and says not all of us are like #1 and #2 (but is otherwise quite)<br />4.) The developer that speaks up, helps with fixing user problems (whether just telling you how. or writing a patch) and is polite about it. Sometimes they won&rsquo;t fix your problem now, but hey, programming does take time, and there are priorities.<br /><br />#4 is the only good one of the bunch.<br /><br />I admit that sometimes I am more like #1 than I should be. But we can&rsquo;t all be Buddha all of the time.<br /><br />Those of you not striving to be like #4 are part of the problem. I don&rsquo;t want to use your project.  Even if I could fix your project I wouldn&rsquo;t, because I have more important things to do, and better people to help.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
