  <p>I think the idea of a meta distro on top of a stable base is the way to go, let people choose just what they want on bleeding edge. I like my kernel, gcc, and perl solid, sometimes I want firefox&rsquo;s beta&rsquo;s but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I want the rest of the system like that. At some point gentoo&rsquo;s ~arch became more stable that stable, this needs to end. Even if it means making stable a bit more unstable. I&rsquo;d like to see more people running stable systems.<br /><br />~arch is going to be aimed more at things that are stable enough, and pending stable. It&rsquo;s going to become more unstable than it is in a sense because I&rsquo;m not afraid to hardmask stuff that was ~arch and is found to be broken. I&rsquo;m also not afraid to release slightly broken stuff into ~arch, for example I&rsquo;ll release a new git into ~arch without an update noperl patch which means using -perl won&rsquo;t work. I won&rsquo;t release completely broken or overtly buggy things into ~arch though, I&rsquo;m just not afraid to release with a missing patch (set) as long as it&rsquo;ll build and work in most cases and update later.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ve decided on a policy for stabilizing the kernel, first of regen2&rsquo;s kernel is vanilla-sources, if you&rsquo;re running another sources this doesn&rsquo;t apply. I will stabilize the previous kernel when the new major version is released so I will stabilize 2.6.28.x when 2.6.29 comes out, after that I will stabilize each new kernel a few days after it hits the tree (actually I may not wait), since the kernel&rsquo;s development model makes it highly unlikely that regressions will be introduced that late in the cycle. I may use a similar update scheme for other packages but it will be a package by package basis. But likely once a major version moves to stable it will be trivial to move new minor versions to stable.<br /><br />I want to know what people use? what should be stable in regen2. 2 things I won&rsquo;t stabilize right now are qt-4.5 and kde-4.2. They work well enough but have too many bugs upstream, imho (should a kde developer look at this feel free to look at my buglist on your bug tracker, prtscrn must work before I&rsquo;ll mark kde stable, but hey at least dpms works with screensaver now). Anything else goes what do you use/need that&rsquo;s in ~arch and has been there for a long time. feel free to mention in comments, the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/regen2-dev">dev list</a> or the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/regen2/issues/list">Bug tracker</a"><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
