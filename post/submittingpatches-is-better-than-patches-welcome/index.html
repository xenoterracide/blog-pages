  <p>So I received my first patch for Perl code a week ago. Amazingly I didn&rsquo;t have to tell the person patches were welcome, they must have assumed so because my project was licensed under an OSI approved license. Also amazingly I&rsquo;ve applied the patch even though it didn&rsquo;t meet my quality standards. I figure that&rsquo;s my fault though because no where did I document what those were.<br /><br />Back when I forked Regen2 from Funtoo one of the first things I did (and a reason for the fork) was create a policy for patch submission. The policy for Funtoo was that all patches were welcome, and I recall 2 patches by 1 user specifically that should have been 10 patches and 2 (or more) of those 10 patches should have been dropped, because they were doing things they shouldn&rsquo;t have. In order to create this policy as easily as possible, I stole Git&rsquo;s SubmittingPatches policy and modified it to work with Regen2.<br /><br />Once again I&rsquo;ve been faced with patches that just aren&rsquo;t up to par. So once again I&rsquo;m using Git&rsquo;s policy as a baseline for contributions to my projects. Here&rsquo;s the beginning of the documentation<br /><br /><blockquote>Checklist (and a short version for the impatient):<br /><br /> Commits:<br /><br /> - make commits of logical units<br /> - check for unnecessary whitespace with &ldquo;git diff &ndash;check&rdquo;<br />   before committing<br /> - do not check in commented out code or unneeded files<br /> - the first line of the commit message should be a short<br />   description and should skip the full stop<br /> - the body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:<br />  - uses the imperative, present tense: &ldquo;change&rdquo;,<br />    not &ldquo;changed&rdquo; or &ldquo;changes&rdquo;.<br />  - includes motivation for the change, and contrasts<br />    its implementation with previous behaviour<br /> - if you want your work included in the main repository, add a<br />   &ldquo;Signed-off-by: Your Name <a href="mailto:you@example.com">you@example.com</a>&rdquo; line to the<br />   commit message (or just use the option &ldquo;-s&rdquo; when<br />   committing) to confirm that you agree to the Developer&rsquo;s<br />   Certificate of Origin<br /> - make sure that you have tests for the bug you are fixing<br /> - make sure that the test suite passes after your commit<br /><br /> Patch:<br /><br /> - use &ldquo;git format-patch -M&rdquo; to create the patch<br /> - do not PGP sign your patch<br /> - be careful doing cut &amp; paste, not to corrupt whitespaces.<br /> - provide additional information (which is unsuitable for<br />   the commit message) between the &ldquo;&mdash;&rdquo; and the diffstat<br /> - if you change, add, or remove any features or<br />   make some other user interface change, the associated<br />   documentation should be updated as well.<br /> - if your name is not writable in ASCII, make sure that<br />   you send the patch in the correct encoding.<br /><br />Long version:<br /><a href="http://github.com/xenoterracide/Template-ShowStartStop/blob/build/master/SubmittingPatches">&hellip;</a><br /></blockquote><br />The only part I added was to add documentation for features. Obviously some parts under patch need modification as I&rsquo;m not using a mailing list.<br /><br />Obviously <a href="http://xenoterracide.blogspot.com/2010/05/dont-say-patches-welcome.html">part of the reason I don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;Patches welcome&rdquo;</a> is I&rsquo;ve seen that policy lead to the acceptance of really bad patches. Now obviously I make mistakes, everyone makes mistakes, but patches can be improved before they are committed. Even good patches can be flat out rejected for other reasons (I&rsquo;ve had this happen. The consensus was not that the patch was bad, but the entire script need to be rewritten).<br /><br />So what was wrong with this patch if I accepted it? well essentially it wasn&rsquo;t a git patch and it was applied to the wrong directory (because I had the original source in src/ and the generated a / I&rsquo;m not using CommitBuild to another branch) and, it also broke my test suite (even though it was a patch for a test. The breakage was a bug in another test).<br /><br />In any event, I believe that having your project be &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo; and having a patch submission policy does more to say &ldquo;Patches Welcome&rdquo; than &ldquo;Patches Welcome&rdquo;. You don&rsquo;t have to agree with that, but regardless of whether you do, or not, I think having a policy is a good thing.<br /><br />P.S. Trolling posts will be deleted. Be constructive or talk elsewhere.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
