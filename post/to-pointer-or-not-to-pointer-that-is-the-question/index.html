  <p>For a very long time now I&rsquo;ve been looking for good explanations of pointers, and how the varying kinds differ.I&rsquo;ve finally found a book that does a good job of explaining what they are and how they differ. The book is by Bjarne Stroustrup (the creator of C++) it&rsquo;s called <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-C/dp/0321543726?ie=UTF8&tag=xenotsblog-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969">Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=xenotsblog-20&l=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969&o=1&a=0321543726" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important; padding: 0px !important" />. The book is supposed to teach you how to program (become a good programmer) using C++ not teach the C++ language. The question that Stroustrup poses is <cite>How do we choose between using a reference argument and using a pointer argument?</cite> his answer to the question is quite in depth, however I&rsquo;ll reiterate his summary here in the hopes that it&rsquo;s useful for someone. <blockquote>So, the real answer is: &ldquo;The choice depends on the nature of the the function&rdquo;:<br /><ul><li>For tiny objects prefer pass-by-value.</li><li>For functions where &ldquo;no object&rdquo; (represented by a 0) is a valid argument use a pointer parameter (and remember to test for 0).</li><li>Otherwise, use a reference parameter.</li></ul></blockquote>Ok, that alone seems a little confusing. I&rsquo;m just going to use function declarations to denote the differences in code.<br /><br />According to him, pass by value is the least error prone, but it copies memory and is therefore more expensive. To do this you&rsquo;d declare a function like <code>int func_name(int x);</code>.<br /><br />&ldquo;No object&rdquo; in my quote is another term for &ldquo;Null pointer&rdquo; which he defined previous to this but wasn&rsquo;t in my quote. If no argument to the function is valid you&rsquo;d use that. It&rsquo;s declared like <code>int func_name(int* x);</code><br /><br />The last option is to use a reference pointer. these are declared as <code>int func_name(int&amp; x)</code>.<br /><br />I still have some trouble with the what/why/when to use pointers, but I&rsquo;ll probably just go back through this a few times. Stroustrup&rsquo;s explanation is still the best I&rsquo;ve seen. I&rsquo;d suggest his book to any novice programmer. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the best for someone who&rsquo;s never seen any code as it goes quite fast. It doesn&rsquo;t spend hardly any time at all on language constructs, which most books do. I don&rsquo;t think so fast that you couldn&rsquo;t use it as a &lsquo;first programming book&rsquo; but it might be good to have a book that covers the constructs (like for loop) in depth.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
