  <p>In short a concept aimed at forking Gentoo Linux. First some history and my own experiences.<br /><br />Gentoo is a sick adolescent who refuses to acknowledge his illness. Because he refuses to acknowledge the illness he can&rsquo;t be helped. There are many who have ideas about how to help him. Some of those are wrong.<br /><br />Gentoo&rsquo;s biggest problem? Democracy. Making it actually work is not easy.  Most of the really successful, open source, projects have one or two people at the top. A good benevolent leader is needed, imho. Gentoo&rsquo;s developer council did not seem to have things under control for the better part of 2007. Some things seem to have improved but I have lost faith in them.<br /><br />Dan Robbins (gentoo&rsquo;s creator an prior benevolent dictator) made 2 offers to help, but left quickly after both. It is obvious that he can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t (shouldn&rsquo;t?) attempt to save Gentoo.<br /><br />Political is Gentoo&rsquo;s biggest thorn and as a result it is suffering technically.<br /><br />Portage (gentoo&rsquo;s ports like package manager) is said to be unmaintainable, buggy, and un-fixable. I believe there are 3 package managers being written separately, with the idea of being alternatives. From what I&rsquo;ve seen of Paludis and Pkg-core neither of them have the right idea for an actual replacement. I will go into that in another post.<br /><br />Gentoo&rsquo;s dev&rsquo;s have no respect for standards or conventions, and as such certain area&rsquo;s which could be easily fixed have suffered. such as Gentoo&rsquo;s Apache binary being named apache and apache2 instead of httpd which is mostly a convention, or the lack of an /srv which is not optional according to FHS.<br /><br />Gentoo lacks a sense of business, to the point the foundations charter was revoked (or was it almost revoked, plenty of confusion to be sure). If support rallies behind me (or the idea) I fully intend on incorporating for the purpose of commercially supporting the distribution.<br /><br />In short,  I hope ReGen2 will be a commercial funded, rapid developing, fast, versatile, source based linux distribution. Which will continue to be a leader in the open source world.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
