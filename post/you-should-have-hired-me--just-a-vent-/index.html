  <p>So this is about the 10th time my friend has asked me for help on a SQL (w/ SQL Server) problem. I Actually interviewed with his company at one point and they elected NOT to hire me. Why? because I have never found windows errors useful, have therefore never used its logging facility, and was unable to answer questions about it. I&rsquo;m was a UNIX guy then and am now. But I&rsquo;m still better at figuring out problems on software I&rsquo;ve never even used, with only about 1/10th of the information that I need. I&rsquo;m so tired of fixing other people&rsquo;s problems and not getting paid for it, especially when somehow they profit from it.<br /><br />So why don&rsquo;t companies seem to hire me? Because I suck at interviews. Because I don&rsquo;t have that 4 year degree and someone else does. Because I don&rsquo;t have 2 years of experience with Technology X. Because I&rsquo;ve not got the greatest work history.<br /><br />Why don&rsquo;t I have the greatest work history? Well I&rsquo;ve been fired twice. Once the official reason was I fell asleep at work, I don&rsquo;t think I did. Even if I did I had, had insomnia for 3 days, I even told them that. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I could have sued for wrongful termination, but I didn&rsquo;t. The other time I was hired into a position that I really just wasn&rsquo;t a good match for, but I didn&rsquo;t realize it until later. That position also didn&rsquo;t have enough work for me, and the work that it did have wasn&rsquo;t well enough explained for me to do.<br /><br />Wait so I have to explain to you how to do something? no&hellip; but when you tell me to make a form with this list, and copy this pre-existng product with new tech. Then those 2 definitions conflict. So I try to do work to make what you want and then you say but I don&rsquo;t want those fields&hellip; I say but this can&rsquo;t be made to work like that without them&hellip; I never really got answers&hellip; Can&rsquo;t do work that I&rsquo;m not given enough info to do properly, and I wasn&rsquo;t privy to the meetings with the clients.<br /><br />I&rsquo;d also like to note that I almost quit the second job as I had been given less than 5 hours a week for 3 months, and my boss, although a good hacker, wasn&rsquo;t a very good boss. But I&rsquo;m not completely absent of blame&hellip; maybe I misrepresented my knowledge of the product, or maybe I should have done more to get the information I needed to do the work.<br /><br />Well maybe my luck will change and this company I&rsquo;ve been interviewing with recently will hire me so the next time my friend asks me for help to do his job I can say. You know your company could hire mine and the work would get done faster (better too probably).<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
