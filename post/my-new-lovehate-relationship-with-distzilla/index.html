  <p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Dist-Zilla/">Dist::Zilla</a> is a great release tool, code generator, and it just plain takes the boring part of doing a release away from you.That having been said, it does, imo, horrible things to your source repository. &ldquo;But, Caleb, it cleans up your source repository you can remove a lot of excess stuff you don&rsquo;t really need to be storing there&rdquo;. Well&hellip; I disagree, to the point that I&rsquo;ve used every explicative in the book to express my displeasure. Let me explain why I disagree.<br /><br />First let me explain my use cases. I have only one package on CPAN, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-ShowStartStop/lib/Template/ShowStartStop.pm">Template::ShowStartStop</a> and it&rsquo;s relatively simple to the point that Dist::Zilla is almost overkill (but I still find it nice). I also maintain a sizeable portion of CPAN on Arch Linux&rsquo;s <a href=" http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?SeB=m&L=2&K=xenoterracide">AUR</a>. In addition to standard CPAN Packaging for my own package I created a <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=35120">-git package</a> which allows me to install directly from my source repository on <a href="http://github.com/xenoterracide/Template-ShowStartStop">Github</a>. That worked wonderfully well until I started using Dist::Zilla (note: I haven&rsquo;t gotten a poorly working (read hack that&rsquo;s buggy) version now).<br /><br />So Dist::Zilla is great for CPAN, no problem for normal downstream packages, but makes things more painful for Version Control Users. &ldquo;But Caleb, it does nice things for me for version control&rdquo;. Yes it does, but I think it also has some consequences that people don&rsquo;t realize. If you know how Dist::Zilla works pretend that you don&rsquo;t.<br /><br />Look at my <a href="http://github.com/xenoterracide/Template-ShowStartStop">repo</a> What License is my code licensed under? usually this is in the COPYING file. There&rsquo;s no COPYING file there. How do I install it? No README either, oh and the module isn&rsquo;t complete as is things like version are stripped so Dist::Zilla can generate them for me. This list goes on and on all basically leading back to my issue. Why does Dist::Zilla have to take these things out of my source repository?<br /><br />The answer was&hellip; you wouldn&rsquo;t store .o files in your repository would you? why would you store these generated files&hellip; oh I dunno&hellip; because someone shouldn&rsquo;t have to install Dist::Zilla just to use my latest git? and they aren&rsquo;t like .o files because those are binarily specific to a lot of things and won&rsquo;t be useful on most other machines, unlike these files.<br /><br />Let&rsquo;s say Dist::Zilla has a bug in what they generate for code. They fix it, I update, all is good for me. Someone else who hasn&rsquo;t updated Dist::Zilla downloads the code and builds and hits the bug&hellip; they complain to me. I explain it to them, they update Dist::Zilla, they&rsquo;re happy, I&rsquo;m happy. But we could have avoided this, if I stored all the output in my repo they&rsquo;d never have to worry about Dist::Zilla.<br /><br />So I&rsquo;ve been told this will never be fixed because they don&rsquo;t want to clobber the existing files, plus the whole&hellip; these are like .o files, thing. Ok, clobber == bad. So how could we fix it so I&rsquo;m happy? and everyones happy. We should a directory <code>src</code> shall be the source of all non generated code. Much like when working with compiled code you have a <code>src</code> directory for source files and a directory for output. the lib that&rsquo;s still here will be the final generated lib. All the top level files will also be generated. Only the stuff in <code>src</code> is what should be worked on. And the generated README will give all these wonderful instructions that will now be presented to users visiting the github repo. And when I&rsquo;m writing a -git package I won&rsquo;t have to include any dzil instructions because I don&rsquo;t need to generate this code all the time.<br /><br />and you know what? if people don&rsquo;t want to store generated files in there vcs they can always use something like .gitignore. So everybody should be happy.<br /><br />For backcompat just make it a configuration in dist.ini. We can have a [src] dir which could be . for those who want it the way it works now. and an [output] dir.<br /><br />Will Dist::Zilla be worth this pain? I&rsquo;m not sure.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
