I just woke up this morning banned. I find it interesting that Gentoo and Sabayon are considered ok topics of discussion, and I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten banned for saying use one of those. But Regen2 seems to be a sore spot. I would have left if asked&hellip; I find the ban unnecessary. Or maybe I would have just idled watching for bug reports, I&rsquo;ve unfortunately ended up laughing at most of them, as there have been quite a few on qt, and I preemptively masked the new qt, knowing that upstream wouldn&rsquo;t have it all sorted yet. Anyways&hellip; I&rsquo;d like to state that I personally disagree with all the private discussions that go on in Funtoo. In gentoo the problems are public and distracting, when I was part of Funtoo, they were made private, this does not appear to be different now. It&rsquo;s possible this was discussed in #funtoo-dev as I stopped hanging out in that room when I stopped being a funtoo-dev. I think in general it&rsquo;s a bit hypocritical. I suppose you could say, &ldquo;you were asked to not talk about regen2 what did you expect?&rdquo;, I didn&rsquo;t actually expect not to get banned, I did expect to be asked to leave, or shut up, with the threat of being banned first.<br /><br />Daniel Cordero (TheAppleMan) has offered to grab patches from the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/regen2-dev">regen2-dev</a> mailing list. no solution for overlays for funtoo was ever decided. I have left it up to them to figure it out, since I refuse to maintain both my tree and apply patches to theirs&hellip; (and remove them when they don&rsquo;t want them). I can&rsquo;t actually guarantee either my individual patches or the overlays will be merged.<br /><br />I&rsquo;ll be continuing to import patches from funtoo, although recently I realized it will be most likely impossible to get them all as drobbins commits quite a few patches during his merges. I recently found out that udev had been updated and had some house cleaning done (there is no stable udev in funtoo now (I think I didn&rsquo;t actually check keywords)) all versions before 135 are gone. So I checked to see if I missed a patch&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t which means it was changed in a merge&hellip; those are the only commits affecting those directories.<br /><br />Best of luck to Funtooers.<br /><br />NOTE: ah&hellip; I apologize for the formatting issue in the blockquote, seems to be a problem with blogger. I&rsquo;ve fixed it best I can.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
