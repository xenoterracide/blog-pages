  <p>so the whole &lsquo;open source&rsquo; has no warranty thing keeps coming up as a defensible reason that I&rsquo;m wrong.<br /><br />Microsoft offers a 90 day limited warranty that the software will work to some degree or another as advertised or some such. If you really want to consider what they&rsquo;re saying&hellip; it should work if it doesn&rsquo;t we can send you another disk or you can return for refund. which really is what you could have done at the store anyways. I suppose it also means it won&rsquo;t fry your hardware, does anyone know any stable open source software that does that? I suppose a few things could if tweaked right..<br /><br />Open Source generally doesn&rsquo;t distribute a physical medium, or fry peoples boxen, so what would we even use a warranty for? oh right&hellip; a CYA. We really don&rsquo;t want to be sued because someone downloaded our software and it didn&rsquo;t work or broke something of theirs.<br /><br />Generally your software warranty doesn&rsquo;t really cover support, and if it does it&rsquo;s for a very limited time, and very limited support. Warranties are more for physical medium. For example my Dell came with a 1 year warranty, but because I ordered it with Ubuntu they would provide hardware support only.<br /><br />The point is that if you&rsquo;re claiming we shouldn&rsquo;t support our software because it is without warranty&hellip; the warranty as far as I can  tell doesn&rsquo;t have much to do with the software and everything to do with the medium.<br /><br />Really, the CYA is a good thing. I don&rsquo;t disagree with it&hellip; however, it shouldn&rsquo;t be used as an excuse to do nothing. It just means you can&rsquo;t be legally harmed if you do nothing.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
