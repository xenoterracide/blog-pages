I'm sure you've read about Debian's OpenSSL blunder. If not here's a recap on <a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/135270">Linux.com</a>.<br /><br />I'm just wondering... is it possible that the pain will be so great for admins that the great stable debian will be discontinued from production server use? I would (but I don't use debian based systems for anything but livecds), seriously this is a hugely idiotic mistake the pain of which is only <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/21/massive_debian_openssl_hangover/">beginning</a>. This may in fact be the biggest security blunder I have ever heard of in open source.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />--<br />
