  <p>First off, I&rsquo;m not racist, I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;m not bigoted in any way.<br /><br />But I&rsquo;m tired of all these equality rants from blacks and females.<br /><br />WE WERE SLAVES. So? so what? every race under the sun has had slaves and been enslaved at some point during the history of humans. Why are you special?<br /><br />Why don&rsquo;t we have a white history month? A Jewish history month? A Latino history month? etc, etc. Seriously? why are blacks special? what makes them so abused that they get special recognition.<br /><br />Today I saw an article in the LSJ (<a href="http://www.lsj.com/">http://www.lsj.com/</a>  will find specific link later) That talked about how hard blacks were getting hit by the mortgage crisis. I thought &ldquo;oh and the rest of us aren&rsquo;t?&rdquo;.<br /><br />You know what blacks and women are as about as equal as they are going to get. Don&rsquo;t believe me? look at the presidential race. Actually in some cases non-white males have additional advantages.<br /><br />The only group right now that can really, really claim prejudice are the gays.<br /><br />We need to stop things that promote people of gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation, and start promoting equality. We will never be equal as long as people say that we are not, and continue to promote that we are not equal and that they should have some advantage other than there own personal merit.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
