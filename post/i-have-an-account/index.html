  <p>Most people complain, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what my username and password for site x is&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t have that problem, because I use the username xenoterracide almost everywhere, except for anal places that provide me with usernames, like my bank or school, or don&rsquo;t allow that many characters in the username.<br /><br />My problem is I can&rsquo;t remember all the places I have an account.<br /><br />I was looking at flickr last night, needed an account to look at something. So I went to sign in with my yahoo account. which is/was xeno_terra_cide, accidentally I typed in xenoterracide, because I&rsquo;m so used to it. I discovered that xenoterracide had become available since the last time I checked (when I originally opened an account it was not). So I registered it. Then I went to flickr, it asked for a flicker username so I gave it xenoterracide, it yells at me, user exists. It didn&rsquo;t tell me that when I tried logging in before, it told me user didn&rsquo;t exist and the id was available. So then I get to go about, merging accounts. That was a bit tricky, although less so than when I merged, blogger, adsense, and google accounts.<br /><br />This isn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve forgotten that I have an account someplace and won&rsquo;t be the last. Unfortunately I&rsquo;ve yet to find a system for storing this. I wipe my computer and user account too often. Although that&rsquo;s getting rarer.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
