  <p>So about 2 months ago I got fed up with Sprint (they suck for different reasons) and I already knew that they had better service coverage than Verizon in my area. My friend suggested T-Mobile, so I went and got setup with them for a 14 day trial period. I took the phone made some calls tried the web browser, I didn&rsquo;t like the blackberry itself, but that&rsquo;s besides the point. When I got the phone home, no service, not even outside the house, making T-Mobile worse than Verizon. I didn&rsquo;t want to run 10 miles into town that day, the next day we had a blizzard, so wednesday, two days later I took it back. They charged back everything and everything seemed good. Until a few weeks later when I got a $10 bill for usage. I just finally got around to dealing with customer service today. They say it&rsquo;s accurate, and no they can&rsquo;t do anything. So basically as an FYI to anyone else, don&rsquo;t try T-Mobile unless you already know that their service will work for you because they are going to charge you anyways. This shouldn&rsquo;t be, your service doesn&rsquo;t work for me, you shouldn&rsquo;t charge me to tell you that. Now if I move I probably won&rsquo;t look at them for a service change, had they handled this in an amicable manner I probably would have as soon as there network wasn&rsquo;t an issue. I&rsquo;m also going to tell anyone who asks about cell provider&rsquo;s about it. Yes $10 isn&rsquo;t much, but it&rsquo;s the principle of me having to pay them anything after I had made it clear I wasn&rsquo;t sure it would work and I just wanted to see if it was an option.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
