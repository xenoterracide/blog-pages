Paludis also has it&rsquo;s alpha releases marked as  ~arch, this is a no, no. I also found the people in #paludis on irc to be rude and unhelpful. I was annoyed at the time (so being rude myself) as gentoo kde-svn overlay was going to require paludis which means I was going to be forced to use it. Regardless I&rsquo;ve never been met with lot&rsquo;s of friendliness or help in #paludis. They are an RTFM crowd. I have been told to use paludis several times without even asking about it (as if it is the solution to all problems). So is pkgcore better? I can&rsquo;t say without a doubt that it is.<br /><br /><strong>Why is pkgcore the victor?</strong><br /><br />For starter&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s only the victor for me. paludis is a more mature product at this point and has a stronger following of fanatic&rsquo;s/zealot&rsquo;s.<br /><br />1.) pkgcore it more similar to portage.<br /><br />pkgcore was originally intended to be portage 3. This leads to a large amount of similarities and backwards compatibility.<br /><br />2.) pkgcore devs are really friendly. Sometimes patience is a virtue getting an answer on #pkgcore but most of the times I get one. This allowed me to quickly learn what I could and could not (yet) do with pkgcore, including finding a bug within a week.<br /><br />3.) pkgcore just works. I installed pkgcore and with a quick look at the site was quickly able to start doing work with it.<br /><br />4.) pkgcore installs faster. I think it took like an hour to build paludis on this machine (maybe more) pkgcore took 2 minutes tops.<br /><br />5.) pkgcore uses C. For the parts of portage that were really slow they re-wrote them in C using cpython. using both python and c leads to faster development and speed where needed.<br /><br /><strong>How do I use pkgcore</strong><br />real quick<br /><br /><code>pmaint sync</code><br /><br />this is the biggest adaption from portage, imho and I&rsquo;m not sure why it&rsquo;s not &ndash;sync or pmerge &ndash;sync (in some ways it&rsquo;s more similar to portage 2.0 syntax). This will not only sync your main gentoo tree but any repositories you&rsquo;ve intalled with layman. as of yet you still have to install them via layman, but this may change in the future.<br /><br /><code>pmerge packagename</code><br /><br />I told you this was easy. Most of the options I use work. The biggest that doesn&rsquo;t is &ndash;verbose, this seems to be default now (with &ndash;ask) so an option is no longer needed. updating world<br /><br /><code>pmerge -auDs world</code><br /><br />an -s is now needed to work with things like system and  world. It&rsquo;s for package set. My one complaint here is the &ndash;newuse doesn&rsquo;t currently work with sets. This is a bug and will be fixed in the future.<br /><br /><strong>Is <em>anything</em> wrong with pkgcore in your eyes?</strong><br /><br />well aside from the plethora of missing features (they&rsquo;ll get done, it&rsquo;s just a time thing). Documentation&hellip; I usually learn stuff by reading web documentation (or books) until I&rsquo;m comfortable enough reading man pages. The web documentation for pkgcore needs a lot of work. I may actually volunteer to help with this. I haven&rsquo;t decided yet, and it depends partially on if they want to answer all my questions as I write the docs.<br /><br />It&rsquo;d be nice if at some point pmerge could become emerge etc&hellip; (meaning reprise it&rsquo;s roll as portage 3).<br /><br />for more information on pkgcore go to <a href="http://www.pkgcore.org/trac/pkgcore">pkgcore.org</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
