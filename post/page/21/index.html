  To start I just got this game so I will be expanding this review throughout the next few days.
First the Bad.
The intro movie (to the game) feels more cartoony than the previous ones, I don&rsquo;t like the style. I don&rsquo;t feel that it is on par with Relic&rsquo;s previous movies. This is a trivial complaint and perhaps merely artistic preference.
There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a race intro movie like there was in Dark Crusade.

  First, I enjoyed this movie. I&rsquo;d give it a B grade as far as movies go. However, it can&rsquo;t possibly survive it&rsquo;s own hype. The CGI in the movie is awesome. The story is so, so. Historically it&rsquo;s wildly inaccurate, but you should have known that from the trailer. I won&rsquo;t be buying this one, nore probably watching it again. However, I think it is worth seeing at least once, and probably on the big screen just for the graphics.

  I&rsquo;m not going to mention things that are beyond the control of open source such as drivers and multimedia. These things are the fault of the corporations that control them.
The first thing I think these systems need is a unified password manager. Instead both gnome and kde have there own password storage system and so do a million other apps. I think OpenBSD should lead the pack on this one given there reputation for security.

I went to see this the other night. Because NCG was having problem&rsquo;s with Cloverfield&hellip; and we were already there.
I didn&rsquo;t find it scary at all. A little creepy. The blurry vision and screaming death shadows were just annoying.
I did think that it might be an interesting concept for a Mage Awakening in Mage the Awakening RPG. Not as is of course.&ndash;

  Article.
Well apparently some research has been done, on non-published studies done, that shows for the most part anti-depressants aren&rsquo;t better than placebo&rsquo;s. Say it ain&rsquo;t so&hellip; the drug companies wouldn&rsquo;t not tell us if they knew that you could get the same effect without buying their drugs at $100 a bottle would they?

  Most people complain, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what my username and password for site x is&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t have that problem, because I use the username xenoterracide almost everywhere, except for anal places that provide me with usernames, like my bank or school, or don&rsquo;t allow that many characters in the username.
My problem is I can&rsquo;t remember all the places I have an account.
I was looking at flickr last night, needed an account to look at something.

  At Baker College they don&rsquo;t allow teachers to grade based on attendance. I&rsquo;m sure this policy is common with most schools. So what do the teacher&rsquo;s do? they grade based on participation. This is crap as to be able to participate you must attend the class. What the teacher&rsquo;s are actually doing is re-labeling attendance points as participation. Because it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you take part in a class conversation. All you have to do is show up.

Saw this movie yesterday. It was Ok. It wasn&rsquo;t great, it wasn&rsquo;t horrible. I can&rsquo;t really say anything, good about it. But I can&rsquo;t say anything bad either. I enjoyed it, I won&rsquo;t be buying it, or seeing it again though.&ndash;

  First off, I&rsquo;m not racist, I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;m not bigoted in any way.
But I&rsquo;m tired of all these equality rants from blacks and females.
WE WERE SLAVES. So? so what? every race under the sun has had slaves and been enslaved at some point during the history of humans. Why are you special?
Why don&rsquo;t we have a white history month? A Jewish history month? A Latino history month?
