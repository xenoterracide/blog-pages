  first I hate repositories, but it is unlikely they will go away. So we must strive to make sure that they are only needed for truly rare things. from my perspective the sunrise repo shouldn&rsquo;t exist. and vcs builds should be in the tree. regen2 should strive to have everything possible in the tree. when it can&rsquo;t an overlay should have all the capabilities of the main tree. meaning that an overlay shouldn&rsquo;t automagically be considered less stable and require the keywording of all the ebuilds in it.

  gentoo is a source based distribution, and this is a good thing. why then has the ability to have trunk builds (which has been added to many overlay&rsquo;s) seem like such a hack? all non-binary program ebuilds in the tree should have a &lsquo;trunk&rsquo; version option. emerge &ndash;sync should then be able to find out whether trunk has been updated so you can correctly rebuild programs as needed with emerge &ndash;ask &ndash;verbose &ndash;update &ndash;deep &ndash;newuse world&ndash;

  In short a concept aimed at forking Gentoo Linux. First some history and my own experiences.
Gentoo is a sick adolescent who refuses to acknowledge his illness. Because he refuses to acknowledge the illness he can&rsquo;t be helped. There are many who have ideas about how to help him. Some of those are wrong.
Gentoo&rsquo;s biggest problem? Democracy. Making it actually work is not easy. Most of the really successful, open source, projects have one or two people at the top.

  at the time of this writing. a concept for software with a name that may not be it&rsquo;s final, and it may never get done.
emerge-ng should ultimately be a drop in replacement for the portage package (the main package manager) in gentoo linux.
for clarity I will be referring to portage as the software and if I mean to refer to portage&rsquo;s tree (basically one giant software repository), I will refer to it that way.

  Today fsdaily posted an forum thread asking why they should use linux but not using certain reasons. However, some of the reasons they said can&rsquo;t be used are part of the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) of a computer.
What is TCO? Here&rsquo;s some of what Wikipedia says about it.
A TCO assessment ideally offers a final statement reflecting not only the cost of purchase but all aspects in the further use and maintenance of the equipment, device, or system considered.

  (note: this was originally intended as a reply to Why Is So Hard for Windows Users to Understand That Linux Is Not Windows, but it got so long I felt it should be it&rsquo;s own post. I&rsquo;m not sure the title is good, but it&rsquo;s close enough)
(note: I use the term users in this blog to mean people who use computers that do not, develop, administrate, repair, or are other wise considered power users, and professional computer users.

  I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve read about Debian&rsquo;s OpenSSL blunder. If not here&rsquo;s a recap on Linux.com.
I&rsquo;m just wondering&hellip; is it possible that the pain will be so great for admins that the great stable debian will be discontinued from production server use? I would (but I don&rsquo;t use debian based systems for anything but livecds), seriously this is a hugely idiotic mistake the pain of which is only beginning. This may in fact be the biggest security blunder I have ever heard of in open source.

  The Dvorak Keyboard is supposedly better than the qwerty keyboard.
Theoritically all you have to do is change the keyboard layout in your OS and then pop the keys off your keyboard and re-arrange them (technically the second step isn&rsquo;t required but nicer). However all the keyboards I&rsquo;ve seen attache the F and the J differently (they also have the home row bumps). Why do they attach them differently? why does it matter to them?

  GRUB vs. the Inodes: Who Needs a Bootable System, Anyway?
So apparently ext3 decided to bump the default inode size to 256 however grub 0.97 can&rsquo;t boot this and grub people aren&rsquo;t about to fix it because they are working on grub 2. Yeah that sounds about right&hellip; don&rsquo;t maintain your existing code base even though your next product isn&rsquo;t out yet.
Amarok is doing this too, it&rsquo;s quite annoying, and very poor develompment practice.
