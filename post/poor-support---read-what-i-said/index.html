  <p>For Starters I&rsquo;m annoyed and ranting. I&rsquo;m going to pick on some particular companies, but this problem applies to the WHOLE support industry.<br /><br />Stop using generic scripted answers for problems where they obviously don&rsquo;t apply. I&rsquo;ve used them myself in the support industry, but where they apply.<br /><br /><em>Examples are paraphrased</em><br />Example1: Amazon.com and there poorly worded emails<br /><br />Me&gt; I received an email saying that I had recently bought or viewed lawnmowers, I haven&rsquo;t. Has my account been compromised?<br /><br />amazon&gt; this email is phishing&hellip;(generic phishing email reply here)<br /><br />(I received another similar)<br />Me&gt; Hi I received an email that says I&rsquo;ve bought or viewed power tools. Here are the headers, they pass spamassassin and googles filters. Plus I&rsquo;ve checked it myself. Maybe, you could fix the emails to not to suggest that I&rsquo;ve purchased or viewed something I haven&rsquo;t.<br /><br />amazon&gt; this email is phishing&hellip;(generic phishing email reply here)<br /><br />Solution: disable amazon from sending me emails on products&hellip; and it worked. I guess amazon&rsquo;s support should have paid attention?<br /><br />Example2: safari.oreilly.com<br /><br />Me&gt; I can&rsquo;t get this book to load&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure why. The &lsquo;spinner&rsquo; keeps going <br />round and round but it doesn&rsquo;t load. I don&rsquo;t have problems with anything <br />else.<br /><br />(ok so I could have been clearer on &lsquo;anything else&rsquo; what I meant to say was &lsquo;any other books&rsquo;.)<br /><br />Safari&gt; I tested the book and do not experience any issues. Here&rsquo;s How to enable scripting in IE.<br /><br />Me&gt; I&rsquo;m sorry wouldn&rsquo;t I have had problems with &lsquo;anything else&rsquo; if I didn&rsquo;t have scripting enabled? Also I&rsquo;m not using IE and it&rsquo;s not on my OS (I don&rsquo;t use windows).<br /><br />Solution: this seemed to resolve itself overnight&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t change anything.<br /><br /><br />Stop telling me that it isn&rsquo;t an issue when it is. because you are too lazy to do simple checking.<br /><br />Example3: bugs.gentoo.org<br /><br />Me&gt; new PackageA Stabilized can&rsquo;t be used by packageB version&hellip;<br /><br /><br />Gentoo&gt; PackageB version is unstable marking invalid<br />(I poke around)<br /><br />Me&gt; This is a problem on the stable version as well<br /><br />Gentoo&gt; Oh&hellip;<br /><br />Solution: I mask packageA to keep it from being pulled&hellip; as they seem to refuse de-stabilizing a package that causes problems.<br /><br /><br />There are always other support problems. But the 2 worst I think are not actually paying attention to a support request, and not doing more than a cursory check, for the validity of a problem.<br /><br />EDIT: If your company/whatever has this problem, you aren&rsquo;t alone, the almighty <a href="http://xenoterracide.blogspot.com/2008/05/cant-reach-googlecom-for-at-least-4.html">google</a> has this problem too.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
