  <p>I have been heavily criticized for criticizing, critiquing, and complaining about lack of quality in open source projects. I have done these things because I care, generally because I care about that specific project, or Open Source (or whatever I&rsquo;m talking about) in general. I&rsquo;ve been attacked, insulted, and sworn at. I&rsquo;ve recently come to the realization that the community support that behavior, to the point that they won&rsquo;t stand up against those doing it. It is a very cliquish <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/439">and tribal</a> community, if you&rsquo;re in the <em>in</em> crowd you can do or say what you want, if not you&rsquo;ll be ostracized. I have been ostracized for years. I have decided to join the opinions of those I&rsquo;ve been ostracized by, but also to accept my exile.<br /><br />In order to discontinue my negative and inappropriate behavior, I have to stop caring. I choose now to not care about helping others who cannot (or choose not?) to help themselves. I will no longer complain about the problems of some projects, even those that I can and have provided fixes to the problems for. I will no longer fix problems that do not impact me. I will no longer tell people that they are misguided, no matter how much they are. I will no longer produce anything that doesn&rsquo;t help me. I have to become selfish and stop caring about the problems of others.<br /><br />To this end I&rsquo;m discontinuing my <a href="http://github.com/xenoterracide/AURpan">work</a> on <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux&rsquo;s AUR</a> as it doesn&rsquo;t help me, CPANPLUS::Dist::Arch which does most of the work, is more than capable of doing this for anyone using Arch, the packages will be orphaned. In acceptance of my exile I am removing myself from all IRC channels (though I will continue to connect) unless I have a problem, that way I do not end up causing a problem, it seems even when I have a problem and try to limit it to that I end up causing one. I am going to ask that my blog be removed from the Iron Man &lsquo;competition&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve been told that none of the work I&rsquo;ve done is significant anyways, and thus my loss will not be a loss at all.<br /><br />I will continue working on any project that has some benefit to myself, as my time is precious and I have a life outside of Open Source. I will only do so, however, if it doesn&rsquo;t require me to have an opinion. There is no point in pushing for a fix that I have a workaround for already, I will simply be seen as entitled and asking too much of other peoples time.<br /><br />I can&rsquo;t win the fight by writing patches, or by helping people by answering questions, or sharing my knowledge publicly. So I choose not to fight, I choose to accept that I am not wanted and so I will leave.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
