  <p>If you haven&rsquo;t read <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2008/04/making-secure-recoverable-passwords.html">Part 1</a> please do so.<br /><br />Although the criticism of <a href="http://www.xenoterracide.com/2010/07/making-secure-recoverable-passwords.html">Part 2</a> should be taken with a grain of <a href="http://xkcd.com/538/">XKCD Salt</a>, and even the primary plaintiff admitted that it would take him 2 months to crack the final salted sha512. Usually your attacker shouldn&rsquo;t have your shadow file, and having stored them as anything less is just plain not secure. I will acknowledge it has some merit.<br /><br />Doing a base64 transformation on hex only digits is a bad, idea, and does not have nearly enough possible combinations. Nothing is going to be more secure than random, but random isn&rsquo;t really recoverable, if you lose it. That&rsquo;s why I do some kind of transformation.<br /><br />I believe that somewhere someone suggested that it would be better to convert from the binary digest into base64 as it would be more random than from hex. I believe this is accurate, but the method suggested was in Perl, which is kind of messy, and more importantly hard to remember. So <a href="http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3675/how-can-i-get-a-base64-encoded-shax-on-the-cli">I asked, on unix.stackexchange.com, how I could do this on the command line</a>. Here&rsquo;s the answer I decided to accept:<br /><br /><code>echo -n <code>date</code> | openssl dgst -binary -sha512 | base64</code><br /><br />Remember you should slightly modify the result in a way that you can remember in your head to make it random, and probably use something in place of the &ldquo;date&rdquo; command, since it&rsquo;s not reproduce-able.<br /><br />Again: this is not meant to be as secure as random passwords, just secure enough compared to <i>non random</i> alternatives.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
