  <p><p>Some of you may have noticed a while back that converted <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Pod::Spell">Pod::Spell</a> to the use of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir">File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir</a> instead of keeping the wordlist in <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Pod::Wordlist">Pod::Wordlist::<strong>DATA</strong></a>. This move was made in conjunction with making Pod::Wordlist an Object, and in preparation for a time when you&rsquo;ll be able to specify your own wordlist file. It was also made so that non technical contributors could more easily update the wordlist without going near anything that looked like code. </p><p>So why shouldn&rsquo;t you put them in <code><strong>DATA</strong></code>? According to <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/File::ShareDir">File::ShareDir</a> <blockquote><p>Quite often you want or need your Perl module (CPAN or otherwise) to have access to a large amount of read-only data that is stored on the file-system at run-time. On a linux-like system, this would be in a place such as /usr/share, however Perl runs on a wide variety of different systems, and so the use of any one location is unreliable. Perl provides a little-known method for doing this, but almost nobody is aware that it exists. As a result, module authors often go through some very strange ways to make the data available to their code.</p><p>The most common of these is to dump the data out to an enormous Perl data structure and save it into the module itself. The result are enormous multi-megabyte .pm files that chew up a lot of memory needlessly.</p><p>Another method is to put the data &ldquo;file&rdquo; after the <strong>DATA</strong> compiler tag and limit yourself to access as a filehandle.</p><p>The problem to solve is really quite simple.</p><pre><br />1. Write the data files to the system at install time.<br /> <br />2. Know where you put them at run-time.</pre></blockquote></p><p>Knowing where you put them at run-time is actually still a problem, because, we don&rsquo;t develop in the same spot that perl installs stuff. The first portion of the problem is, &ldquo;my tests can&rsquo;t find my sharedir file&rdquo;. So <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::File::ShareDir">Test::File::ShareDir</a>, which overrides the  File::ShareDir method. People say, use Test::File::ShareDir, it solves the pain, well that&rsquo;s not true, they&rsquo;re missing a different pain. What happens if you&rsquo;re trying to run, say <code>bin/podspell</code> from the git directory? oh right now it can&rsquo;t find the sharedir file again. In that case I could probably work around it, but it&rsquo;s a mild symptom of a greater problem I&rsquo;ve encountered, people aren&rsquo;t deploying CPAN modules, they&rsquo;re deploying from git. Now I could say, &ldquo;not supported&rdquo;, but unfortunately I&rsquo;d usually have to say that to my current boss, or coworker, whomever that may be (and I tried it, didn&rsquo;t work). This isn&rsquo;t actually the root of the problem with Pod::Spell, but I guarantee it was a problem with <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Business::CyberSource">Business::CyberSource</a>. Mostly I feel like leaving Pod::Spell this way is helping to weed out the issues people will have with File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir</p> <p>So what do I think the solution is? There are obviously numerous &ldquo;social&rdquo; problems here, that I don&rsquo;t think can be easily solved. I&rsquo;m sure that <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/KENTNL">Kent Fredric</a>, has a better grasp than I of the technical solutions. Though I have had one reoccurring idea which is apparently not tangible without significant effort. Have a searchable sharedir path, like in unix <code>PERL5_SHAREDIR=&ldquo;./share:$DETECTED_DEV_DIR:$PERL5_LIB&hellip;&rdquo;</code>, and try looking for the &ldquo;file in the path&rdquo; until you find it, then cache that location in memory so you only have to search once per run. This is probably not a good solution for various reasons, or perhaps it&rsquo;s certainly grossly oversimplified in how it could work.</p> <p>Ultimately, there isn&rsquo;t a good solution right now, and I&rsquo;m not sure we&rsquo;ve actually thought of one.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
