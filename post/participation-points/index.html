  <p>At Baker College they don&rsquo;t allow teachers to grade based on attendance. I&rsquo;m sure this policy is common with most schools. So what do the teacher&rsquo;s do? they grade based on participation. This is crap as to be able to participate you must attend the class. What the teacher&rsquo;s are actually doing is re-labeling attendance points as participation. Because it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you take part in a class conversation. All you have to do is show up.<br /><br />I&rsquo;m sorry but I feel this is wrong. I&rsquo;ve had to miss one class twice due to bad weather. I refuse to drive what is normally a 45 Minute drive in white out conditions with a layer of snow on the road. My instructor is going to let me make up more than 1 quiz (the school only allows 1 normally) and I emailed my homework, but I&rsquo;m still screwed out of attendance points, I mean &lsquo;participation&rsquo; points.<br /><br />Just so everyone knows, I&rsquo;m going to a university in the fall.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
