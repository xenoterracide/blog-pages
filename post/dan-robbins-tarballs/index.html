  <p>I think having weekly tarballs is a great idea. But I&rsquo;m less concerned about the release schedule of such things for regen2 and more concerned about the system packages that tarballs contain. A new tarball should be released, 1 week after a new glibc or gcc is updated, for sure, but any system package should be enough. Why 1 week? well once they stabilize they will hit a lot more people who are likely to have bugs, and that gives time for bugs to be fixed before tar-ing it. Why those 2 packages in particular? They are huge and take a long time to compile.<br /><br />I&rsquo;d like to warn people about using Dan Robbins tarballs. I don&rsquo;t think they are stable. I was building 2 systems recently and one was built off of the last Gentoo i686 tarball the other was built off of Dans latest tarball (I think, I had really lost track after 2-3 weeks). I went to build mysql, it failed to build on the Dan Robbins tarball system, couldn&rsquo;t figure out any rhyme or reason why, other than maybe something on his tarball was weird. So I grabbed a gentoo tarball and started over (note both system&rsquo;s were chroot&rsquo;s at the time and had the exact same configs, just different hardware underneath). Everything went fine the second time I tried. So just a word of warning, his tarball&rsquo;s may have problems. No I haven&rsquo;t reported this to him, I don&rsquo;t have the error anymore either, I unfortunately didn&rsquo;t have a good way to get one to him at the time.<br /><br />EDIT: A more recent post from him suggests that this may have been cause by him using the 2007.1 profile which was never really released.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><br />&ndash;<br />
