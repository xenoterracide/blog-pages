      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like the GPL anymore after the &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://perpetualbeta.com/release/2009/11/why-the-gpl-does-not-apply-to-premium-wordpress-themes/&#34;&gt;Theme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100719/01305210269.shtml&#34;&gt;fiasco&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea that a theme, plugin, addon, extension, whatever is &amp;lsquo;derived&amp;rsquo; from the thing it&amp;rsquo;s adding on to and thus must also be GPL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I build a deck onto the back of my house is that deck derived from my house? No! if I take the blueprints of my house and build another one that&amp;rsquo;s 80% like it is that house derived from my house? yes. If I offer a painting service to paint houses and I offer people preexisting color schemes are those schemes derived from their house? should the manufacturer/contractor (whatever) be able to tell me I can&amp;rsquo;t do that, or that I have to share my colorschemes (and how I mix my paint) with him? How STUPID, IMO. But that&amp;rsquo;s what the GPL does, you can&amp;rsquo;t help other people addon to their house without sharing it with the house builder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m all for sharing source code back, and I think if you modify OSS you should have to give your source back. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t modify it and you are just using the the public API, why should you have to give all of your code up for that? or more importantly why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be you be able to choose your own OSI approved license? I mean what if I have a GPL library, a Artistic Library and a BSD library I want to use to build an application, which has an API, must be GPL and so must everyone&amp;rsquo;s apps that add to it. No you may not make a DWTFYWWI plugin, no you may not make a BSD plugin, no you may not release that code into the public domain, because the GPL says so, and I used a library that made me use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well ya know what? I&amp;rsquo;m not going to use the GPL from now on. I need to find a new license that fits my needs (and will not be toxic to others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desire #1. He who modifies my code, and distributes it, must share his code (with me).&lt;br /&gt;Desire #2. He who wants to use my API may do so (so long as he doesn&amp;rsquo;t modify it)&lt;br /&gt;Desire #3. He who wants to copy my code must share it, and any changes.&lt;br /&gt;Desire #4. Some patent protection would be nice&lt;br /&gt;Desire #5. letting users outside your organization utilize it counts as distribution (a&amp;rsquo;la AGPL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the LGPL fits this bill, except for #5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seriously why is it that you could optimize the internals of wordpress and make your own hosted blogging platform and you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to share the changes at all&amp;hellip; but with a theme you do&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there any other licenses I should consider or considerations I should make?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(honestly you don&amp;rsquo;t have to agree with me about not liking the GPL here, this is just me)&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;br /&gt;
