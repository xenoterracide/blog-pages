      <description>&lt;p&gt;For Starters I&amp;rsquo;m annoyed and ranting. I&amp;rsquo;m going to pick on some particular companies, but this problem applies to the WHOLE support industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop using generic scripted answers for problems where they obviously don&amp;rsquo;t apply. I&amp;rsquo;ve used them myself in the support industry, but where they apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Examples are paraphrased&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example1: Amazon.com and there poorly worded emails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me&amp;gt; I received an email saying that I had recently bought or viewed lawnmowers, I haven&amp;rsquo;t. Has my account been compromised?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon&amp;gt; this email is phishing&amp;hellip;(generic phishing email reply here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received another similar)&lt;br /&gt;Me&amp;gt; Hi I received an email that says I&amp;rsquo;ve bought or viewed power tools. Here are the headers, they pass spamassassin and googles filters. Plus I&amp;rsquo;ve checked it myself. Maybe, you could fix the emails to not to suggest that I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased or viewed something I haven&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazon&amp;gt; this email is phishing&amp;hellip;(generic phishing email reply here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution: disable amazon from sending me emails on products&amp;hellip; and it worked. I guess amazon&amp;rsquo;s support should have paid attention?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example2: safari.oreilly.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me&amp;gt; I can&amp;rsquo;t get this book to load&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why. The &amp;lsquo;spinner&amp;rsquo; keeps going &lt;br /&gt;round and round but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t load. I don&amp;rsquo;t have problems with anything &lt;br /&gt;else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(ok so I could have been clearer on &amp;lsquo;anything else&amp;rsquo; what I meant to say was &amp;lsquo;any other books&amp;rsquo;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safari&amp;gt; I tested the book and do not experience any issues. Here&amp;rsquo;s How to enable scripting in IE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me&amp;gt; I&amp;rsquo;m sorry wouldn&amp;rsquo;t I have had problems with &amp;lsquo;anything else&amp;rsquo; if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have scripting enabled? Also I&amp;rsquo;m not using IE and it&amp;rsquo;s not on my OS (I don&amp;rsquo;t use windows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution: this seemed to resolve itself overnight&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t change anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop telling me that it isn&amp;rsquo;t an issue when it is. because you are too lazy to do simple checking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example3: bugs.gentoo.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me&amp;gt; new PackageA Stabilized can&amp;rsquo;t be used by packageB version&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentoo&amp;gt; PackageB version is unstable marking invalid&lt;br /&gt;(I poke around)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me&amp;gt; This is a problem on the stable version as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentoo&amp;gt; Oh&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution: I mask packageA to keep it from being pulled&amp;hellip; as they seem to refuse de-stabilizing a package that causes problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are always other support problems. But the 2 worst I think are not actually paying attention to a support request, and not doing more than a cursory check, for the validity of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: If your company/whatever has this problem, you aren&amp;rsquo;t alone, the almighty &lt;a href=&#34;http://xenoterracide.blogspot.com/2008/05/cant-reach-googlecom-for-at-least-4.html&#34;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt; has this problem too.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;br /&gt;

      <title>Open Source  it or not?</title>
      <link>http://blog.xenoterracide.com/post/open-source--it-or-not/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When building a new web service should you open source it or not? if you do open source it, it may make it harder to have a revenue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am of course building my &lt;nameless&gt; product on a LAMP stack, and I&amp;rsquo;m a huge open source proponent. But if the majority of the revenue model is based around people using my site, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it hurt me to allow others to basically rebuild my site on there own?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking that a dual license (like Trolltech&amp;rsquo;s qt licensing) may be best in this case, preventing people to use the code commercially without paying for a license. But even then I wonder&amp;hellip; part of the idea is that the product will help generate a community that will then be interested in buying &amp;lsquo;dead tree (books)&amp;rsquo; products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to stop &amp;lsquo;beating around the bush&amp;rsquo; on what the proposed product is now (even though this hypothetical question applies to other products as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m building a 3 part product, first is a character database for PnP(like World of Darkness, and Dungeons and Dragons) RPG games, people will be able to use it to store/share there characters and NPC&amp;rsquo;s. Second, will be a chat system allowing Storytellers/Game/Dungeon Masters to play online. Third is an O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Safari Clone that will allow people to read the books (and get definitions in game) online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see my possible revenue&amp;rsquo;s as Advertising, Library Subscription, Reselling, Support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do people think? How should I license the product(s) (I may build it as 3 ultimately)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: I am looking for partners)&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;br /&gt;
