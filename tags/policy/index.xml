      <title>Submitting Patches is better than &#34;Patches Welcome&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I received my first patch for Perl code a week ago. Amazingly I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to tell the person patches were welcome, they must have assumed so because my project was licensed under an OSI approved license. Also amazingly I&amp;rsquo;ve applied the patch even though it didn&amp;rsquo;t meet my quality standards. I figure that&amp;rsquo;s my fault though because no where did I document what those were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back when I forked Regen2 from Funtoo one of the first things I did (and a reason for the fork) was create a policy for patch submission. The policy for Funtoo was that all patches were welcome, and I recall 2 patches by 1 user specifically that should have been 10 patches and 2 (or more) of those 10 patches should have been dropped, because they were doing things they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. In order to create this policy as easily as possible, I stole Git&amp;rsquo;s SubmittingPatches policy and modified it to work with Regen2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again I&amp;rsquo;ve been faced with patches that just aren&amp;rsquo;t up to par. So once again I&amp;rsquo;m using Git&amp;rsquo;s policy as a baseline for contributions to my projects. Here&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of the documentation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Checklist (and a short version for the impatient):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Commits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - make commits of logical units&lt;br /&gt; - check for unnecessary whitespace with &amp;ldquo;git diff &amp;ndash;check&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;   before committing&lt;br /&gt; - do not check in commented out code or unneeded files&lt;br /&gt; - the first line of the commit message should be a short&lt;br /&gt;   description and should skip the full stop&lt;br /&gt; - the body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:&lt;br /&gt;  - uses the imperative, present tense: &amp;ldquo;change&amp;rdquo;,&lt;br /&gt;    not &amp;ldquo;changed&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;changes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;  - includes motivation for the change, and contrasts&lt;br /&gt;    its implementation with previous behaviour&lt;br /&gt; - if you want your work included in the main repository, add a&lt;br /&gt;   &amp;ldquo;Signed-off-by: Your Name &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:you@example.com&#34;&gt;you@example.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; line to the&lt;br /&gt;   commit message (or just use the option &amp;ldquo;-s&amp;rdquo; when&lt;br /&gt;   committing) to confirm that you agree to the Developer&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br /&gt;   Certificate of Origin&lt;br /&gt; - make sure that you have tests for the bug you are fixing&lt;br /&gt; - make sure that the test suite passes after your commit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Patch:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - use &amp;ldquo;git format-patch -M&amp;rdquo; to create the patch&lt;br /&gt; - do not PGP sign your patch&lt;br /&gt; - be careful doing cut &amp;amp; paste, not to corrupt whitespaces.&lt;br /&gt; - provide additional information (which is unsuitable for&lt;br /&gt;   the commit message) between the &amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; and the diffstat&lt;br /&gt; - if you change, add, or remove any features or&lt;br /&gt;   make some other user interface change, the associated&lt;br /&gt;   documentation should be updated as well.&lt;br /&gt; - if your name is not writable in ASCII, make sure that&lt;br /&gt;   you send the patch in the correct encoding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long version:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/xenoterracide/Template-ShowStartStop/blob/build/master/SubmittingPatches&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only part I added was to add documentation for features. Obviously some parts under patch need modification as I&amp;rsquo;m not using a mailing list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously &lt;a href=&#34;http://xenoterracide.blogspot.com/2010/05/dont-say-patches-welcome.html&#34;&gt;part of the reason I don&amp;rsquo;t like &amp;ldquo;Patches welcome&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that policy lead to the acceptance of really bad patches. Now obviously I make mistakes, everyone makes mistakes, but patches can be improved before they are committed. Even good patches can be flat out rejected for other reasons (I&amp;rsquo;ve had this happen. The consensus was not that the patch was bad, but the entire script need to be rewritten).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what was wrong with this patch if I accepted it? well essentially it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a git patch and it was applied to the wrong directory (because I had the original source in src/ and the generated a / I&amp;rsquo;m not using CommitBuild to another branch) and, it also broke my test suite (even though it was a patch for a test. The breakage was a bug in another test).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I believe that having your project be &amp;ldquo;Open Source&amp;rdquo; and having a patch submission policy does more to say &amp;ldquo;Patches Welcome&amp;rdquo; than &amp;ldquo;Patches Welcome&amp;rdquo;. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to agree with that, but regardless of whether you do, or not, I think having a policy is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Trolling posts will be deleted. Be constructive or talk elsewhere.&lt;div class=&#34;blogger-post-footer&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;br /&gt;
